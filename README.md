# F1-Data-Exploration
As part of my project for a data science course, I explore a Formula 1 dataset and perform data cleaning, analysis, and modelling. 
In the end, I created a simple model to predict podium finishes for a given car, driver, and track combination. The jupyter notebook file goes through my whole thought process, including: the cleaning of the data, logic behind the model, and any biases or conclusions regarding the model.
